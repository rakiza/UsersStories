# A user story is a simple description of a user’s expressed need or expectation and is used in the area of software development and new product design to determine the features to be developed.

Principles
A user story is a simple phrase in everyday language to define with sufficient precision the content of a feature to be developed. It generally contains three descriptive elements of the functionality, in the form:

as a who, I want to what in order to why
The "as a" indicates the user from whose point of view we stand. This is often a role in the use of the product (for example “administrator”, “scientist” or “automaton technician”). To better illustrate the diversity of needs, we can also use the concept of persona, that is, a fictional person, representative of categories of users of the product, and to whom we can identify to better understand his expectations. The identification and description of the personas is then done before the writing of the user stories.
The "whats" briefly describes the expected functionality or behaviour. The purpose of the narrative is not to provide a comprehensive explanation. It is obtained interactively during a conversation with the users concerned or their representatives.
The "why" allows to identify the interest of the functionality and to justify its development. It also allows us to better assess the story’s priority.




Examples
As an administrator,
I want to be able search my users by first and last name and specialty in order to find them quickly when I receive a new request from a user .

As an automaton technician,
I want to be able to declare a new .dat file. in order to save the metadata in the database

As an automaton technician,
I want to be able to find a signal in order to provide to users information on the signals (twin signals, name, ...)

As an scientist,
I want to be able to find a specific signal in order analyze it.
